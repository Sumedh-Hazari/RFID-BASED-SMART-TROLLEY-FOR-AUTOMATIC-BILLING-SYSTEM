The modern technology has increased the standard of living for the humans. This resulted in large crowds at shopping malls. To handle the large crowd, we
must reduce the process of the billing time. This is done using smart shopping system based on RFID. Items that are put in a smart shopping cart are read one
by one and the bill is generated and displayed. After the final bill is generated the customer pays the bill by using their Pre charged cards provided by the
shopping mall. The aim is to reduce the time consumption needed for the billing system.
